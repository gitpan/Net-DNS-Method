Net::DNS::Method
================

This is a simple infrastructure for building "programatic" DNS
servers. This would be a DNS server that can construct an answer based
on a query. An example, would be building the names corresponding to
addresses in a pool such as in

	10.10.10.10.in-addr.arpa IN PTR host-10-10-10-10.ourdomain.com

This infrastructure, while simple, is powerful enough so as to permit
DBI-based servers and other goodies. Servers supporting millions of
queries a day have been built (and are running today) using this code.

The following classes are included

Net::DNS::Method - The base class from which all DNS resolver methods
		   should inherit. This includes code to automatically
		   create default methods for all known
		   Net::DNS::RR resource records.

Net::DNS::Method::Constant - Provides a simple mechanism for answering
			     fixed sets of RRs for queries matching a
			     given criteria.

Net::DNS::Method::Hash - Provides a resolver class that can store
			 answer RRs in hashes. This allows for a very
			 fast, in-memory server. Note that the hashes
			 can be tie()d to data sources such as DBI.

Net::DNS::Method::Pool - Automates the generation of names / reverse
			 RRs for pools of IP space.

Net::DNS::Method::Regexp - Allows a Perl's regexp to match the
			   question in a DNS query. The answer is then
			   constructed by the passed parameters.

Net::DNS::Method::Status - Emits a simple status report about the
			   server's activity.

INSTALLATION

DOCUMENTATION

Complete documentation is included in this package, accessible through
perldoc.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Net::DNS
   File::Find

This module is currently maintained under Perl 5.6.x. While it may run
under earlier Perls with slight modifications, support under such old
environments might be more complicated for the author. Seriously, you
should be thinking about upgrading. Really.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have no control on the machanisms involved in the storage or
transport of this distribution.  This means that I cannot guarantee
that the distribution you have in your hands is indeed, the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

You should have a file with the extension ".asc" along the .tar.gz
uploaded to CPAN.  This contains a GPG "detached signature" that makes
it impossible for anybody to alter this distribution.  If security is
of any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file
and contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.
